# programming-journey-python
<h1>Introduction</h1>
<h2>The following projects serve as prominemt learning milestones accomplised throught a self-directed educational endeavor. This journey encompasses the acquisition od advanced Objecte-Oriented Programming(OOP)
concepts including the topicssuch as inheritance, encapsulation and polymorphism.
Additionally it explores python's diverse data structures including lists, dictionaries, sets and tuples showcasing the practical use of these data structures in real-world applications.
Furthermore this journey also introduces the fundamentals  of Graphical User Interface (GUI) programming in Python, demonstrating a well-rounded skillset that combines the principle of OOP with the practicale user interface design and implementation.
Resources used during the process: <a href="www.w3school.com">w3School</a> and Udemy course <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/?kw=100+days+of+code+the+complete&src=sac">100 days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp 2023 </a>Created by Dr. Angela Yu</h2>

  <li><h1>Project 1: Ping Pong</h1>
    <h2>This particular project, referred to as the 'Ping Pong Project,' serves as a practical illustration of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles, emphasizing the application of inheritance. It mimics the classic game, featuring two paddles located at the sides of the screen, which move vertically in an attempt to prevent the ball from exiting the play area. Each class within this project is meticulously designed, featuring a minimum of two functions, each dedicated to performing distinct and specialized tasks.</h2>
    <h3>Learning Outcome</h3>
    <h4>
  The skill set acquired through this learning journey includes a comprehensive grasp of code encapsulation, a fundamental understanding of inheritance, and the practical expertise required for creating and effectively structuring classes. This knowledge not only enhances code organization and reusability but also empowers the development of more robust and maintainable software solutions.</h4></li>
